-----------------------------------------------------------------
I. COMMONS
1. SELECT Statement
	Full display of the data in the student table, sample:
		USE fcc_sql_guides_database;
		SELECT studentID, FullName, sat_score, programOfStudy, rcd_Created, rcd_Updated 
		FROM student
		WHERE (studentID BETWEEN 1 AND 5 OR studentID = 8)
			AND
			sat_score NOT IN (1000, 1400);
		/*WHERE statement with multiple conditions*/

	Get list of fields of study (DISTINCT), sample:
		SELECT DISTINCT programOfStudy FROM student;
	
2. INSERT Statement
	Single INSERT statement, syntax: 	
		INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
		VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

	Multiple INSERT statement, syntax:
		INSERT INTO Person(Id, Name, DateOfBirth, Gender)
		VALUES (1, ‘John Lennon’, ‘1940-10-09’, ‘M’), (2, ‘Paul McCartney’, ‘1942-06-18’, ‘M’),
		(3, ‘George Harrison’, ‘1943-02-25’, ‘M’), (4, ‘Ringo Starr’, ‘1940-07-07’, ‘M’);

	
3. UPDATE Statement
	UPDATE table_name
	SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
	WHERE condition;
	
4. GROUP BY Statement
	SELECT column_name, COUNT(1), AVG(num_field) AS avg_new_field_name
	FROM table_name
	GROUP BY column_name
	HAVING COUNT(*) > value;		/**Condition on GROUP: HAVING/
	※： COUNT(*) statement must to be replaced by COUNT(1) for performance higher.

5. ORDER BY Statement
	SELECT studentID, FullName, sat_score
	FROM student
	ORDER BY FullName DESC, sat_score ASC;
	
6. DELETE Statement
	DELETE FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. JOIN:
2.1 LEFT JOIN (RIGHT JOIN)
	returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. 
	SELECT * FROM A x LEFT JOIN B y ON y.aId = x.Id
	
2.2 FULL OUTER JOIN
	returns all rows for which there is a match in either of the tables. 
	SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
	FROM Customers
	FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
	ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
	ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName
	
2.3 INNER JOIN
	Return complete matching values in both tables.
	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table1
	INNER JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. FUNCTIONS
1. COUNT: 
	If is a NOT NULL value, then interval count. (number of rows)
	So Count(1) and Count(0) is the same result. 
		
2. SUM: count value of rows

3. LIKE: 
	LIKE is used in a WHERE or HAVING
	SELECT studentID, FullName, sat_score, rcd_updated
	FROM student 
	WHERE 
		FullName LIKE 'Monique%' OR 
		FullName LIKE '%Greene'; 
		
4. DISTINCT
	SELECT DISTINCT programOfStudy FROM student;
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. Database Structure:
4.1 CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_1 datatype,
    column_2 datatype,
    column_3 datatype
);

4.2 CHECK
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255),
	/* CHECK (Age>=18) 											※: Single CHECK */
    CONSTRAINT CHK_Person CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes')	※: Multiple CHECK
);
--------------
4.3 ALTER TABLE
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	ADD column_name datatype;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
V. ADVANCE:
Some bellow advance methods is usually used for generating data.
5.1 "SELECT INTO" Statement
TODO: SELECT INTO is used to create a new table and puts the data in it.
Syntax: 
	SELECT column-names
		  INTO new-table-name
		  FROM table-name
		 WHERE EXISTS 
			  (SELECT column-name
				 FROM table-name
				WHERE condition)
Sample:
	SELECT * INTO SupplierUSA
		  FROM Supplier
		 WHERE Country = 'USA';
		


5.2 "INSERT INTO SELECT" Statement
TODO: "INSERT INTO SELECT" is used to inserts data into an existing table.
Syntax:
	INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
	SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
	FROM table1
	WHERE condition;

5.3 UPDATE "Columns" Statement
	UPDATE table_name1
	SET table_name1.column1 = table_name2.columnA
		table_name1.column2 = table_name2.columnB
	FROM table_name1
	JOIN table_name2 ON table_name1.ForeignKey = table_name2.Key

5.4 Trigger
	A trigger is a stored procedure that runs automatically when various events happen (eg update, insert, delete).
	Syntax:
		create trigger [trigger_name] 
		[before | after]  
		{insert | update | delete}  
		on [table_name]  
		[for each row]  
		[trigger_body] 
	
	Sample:
		create trigger stud_marks 
		before INSERT 
		on 
		Student 
		for each row 
		set Student.total = Student.subj1 + Student.subj2 + Student.subj3, Student.per = Student.total * 60 / 100;
	
5.5 Store Procedure
	A stored procedure is a user defined piece of code written in the local version of PL/SQL, 
	which may return a value (making it a function) that is invoked by calling it explicitly.
	Syntax:
		CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
		AS
		sql_statement
		GO;

	Sample:
		CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30)
		AS
		SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
		GO;

5.6 Sub queries
	* SELECT Statement
	Syntax:
		SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
		FROM   table1 [, table2 ]
		WHERE  column_name OPERATOR
		   (SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
		   FROM table1 [, table2 ]
		   [WHERE])
	Sample:  
		SELECT * 
		FROM CUSTOMERS 
		WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID 
			 FROM CUSTOMERS 
			 WHERE SALARY > 4500) ;
			 
	* INSERT Statement
	INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS_BKP
	SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
	WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID 
	FROM CUSTOMERS) ;
			 
	* UPDATE Statement
	UPDATE CUSTOMERS
	SET SALARY = SALARY * 0.25
	WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS_BKP
		WHERE AGE >= 27 );

	* DELETE Statement		 
	DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
	WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS_BKP
		WHERE AGE >= 27 );
			 
[?] Difference between JOIN and UNION in SQL?
	- Result:
		JOIN: By matching conditions
		UNION: Combines the result-set of SELECT statement
	- Table size:
		JOIN: generate more columns, column names and data type is not same.
		UNION: Generate more rows, column names and data type must to be same.
